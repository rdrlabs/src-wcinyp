# Confirmation Call Guidelines

This guide outlines the protocols for pre-appointment patient confirmation calls. These calls ensure patients are prepared for their appointments and help minimize issues at time of service.

This page is actively being updated. Use as a reference guide for current protocols.

## Before Calling

### 1. Verify Orders
- **Epic or Media Verification**
  - Ensure order is verified
  - Add verification note if missing
  - Flag missing scripts if not in Media or OnBase
- **PTHS (Patient Has Script)**
  - Minimize calls to provider offices
  - Confirm PTHS and verify prescription components with patient
  - Avoid surprises at time of service

### 2. Obtaining Orders
- Always request orders be sent to pre-registration email or management
- Document if patient declines
- Use judgment based on appointment timing
- Exhaust all patient options before contacting providers
- Note: On-call providers (weekends/evenings) are for emergent concerns only

### 3. Verify Protocols
- Check all notes and Snapshot (for MRI appointments)
- Place problem flags for backend follow-up
- Complete confirmation calls in timely manner

### 4. Timing Considerations
- Avoid calling very early in the day as a courtesy to patients

## Additional Considerations

### General Guidelines
- No calls needed for pre-paid portal copayments
- Check Appointment Desk to ensure patient isn't currently at an appointment
- Review self-scheduled same-day appointments (calls may not be warranted)
- Check recent contact history from other departments
- Be mindful of multiple WCINYP appointments:
  - Confirm appointments don't conflict
  - Ensure patient awareness of all appointments
  - Note: Same-day WCINYP appointments require only one copayment (highest amount)
