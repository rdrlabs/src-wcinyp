# Stack Compatibility Research Request for Modern Web Application

## Context
I attempted to build a medical administrative tool using Docusaurus + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4 Alpha. This failed catastrophically due to fundamental incompatibilities between these technologies. I've learned from these mistakes and now need your help researching the optimal stack for my actual requirements.

## My Requirements

### Core Needs
1. **Rapid UI prototyping** with shadcn/ui components
2. **Documentation system** that auto-generates from markdown (like Docusaurus does)
3. **3-4 main application areas**: Document Hub, Provider Directory, Form Builder, Reporting
4. **Maximum compatibility** between all tools in the stack
5. **Long-term maintainability** with established best practices

### What I Liked About Docusaurus
- Automatic documentation generation from markdown
- Built-in search, navigation, versioning
- Minimal configuration needed
- Focus on content, not infrastructure

### Why It Failed
- Docusaurus is for documentation sites, not applications
- CSS conflicts between Infima (Docusaurus) and Tailwind
- Can't properly integrate modern component libraries
- Wrong architectural foundation

## Research Request

Please research and recommend a modern stack that:

1. **Works seamlessly with shadcn/ui** (which requires Tailwind CSS)
2. **Provides documentation capabilities** without the limitations of a pure doc site
3. **Supports the application features I need** (interactive components, forms, data management)
4. **Has proven compatibility** between all parts of the stack
5. **Is actively maintained** with strong community support

### Specific Questions to Answer

1. **Application Framework**: What should replace Docusaurus as the main framework?
   - Next.js? Remix? Vite? Something else?
   - Which has best shadcn/ui support?
   - Which handles both app + docs well?

2. **Documentation Solution**: How to get Docusaurus-like features in an app framework?
   - Nextra (Next.js + MDX)?
   - Astro with Starlight?
   - Custom MDX solution?
   - Separate docs site?

3. **Component Architecture**: 
   - Is shadcn/ui the right choice?
   - Any compatibility concerns to watch for?
   - Best practices for component organization?

4. **CSS Strategy**:
   - Tailwind CSS stable version (not alpha)?
   - CSS modules for isolation?
   - How to prevent conflicts?

5. **Testing & Build Tools**:
   - Vitest vs Jest for modern React?
   - Best practices for component testing?
   - CI/CD considerations?

## Key Lessons Learned (Don't Repeat These)

From the attached technical analysis:

1. **Never mix documentation frameworks with application frameworks**
2. **Avoid alpha/beta versions in production** (I used Tailwind v4 Alpha)
3. **Respect technology boundaries** - some tools aren't meant to work together
4. **Start with the right foundation** - changing later is painful
5. **CSS architecture conflicts can kill a project**
6. **Test infrastructure must work from day one**

## Deliverable

Please provide:
1. **Recommended stack** with specific versions
2. **Compatibility matrix** showing how pieces work together
3. **Implementation order** (what to build first)
4. **Potential pitfalls** to avoid
5. **Example projects** using this stack successfully
6. **Migration strategy** from current empty state

Focus on **proven, stable, compatible technologies** that work well together for building a modern web application with excellent documentation capabilities.
