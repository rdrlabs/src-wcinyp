## Command Patterns

- Base command: `[command]` - Standard execution
- Bang variant: `[command!]` - Fast/enhanced mode
- With args: `[command "argument"]` - Parameterized execution

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ Defined: All commands have prompt templates
üöß Evolving: Commands improve based on usage
üìù Documented: This reference + individual prompts in `.ai/prompts/`

## Future: Native Integration

Goal: Convert to native Claude commands when/if API supports:
- `/ship` instead of `[ship]`
- Auto-completion
- Built-in parameter validation
- Command history

For now, the `[command]` syntax works well and is consistent.
