# React Router v7 Foundation Setup

**Summary**: Created React Router v7 project as foundation for WCINYP medical admin tool, following Gemini's architectural recommendations.

**Key Points**:
- ✅ React Router v7 project initialized
- ✅ AI documentation structure created (.ai/CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Avoided Docusaurus entirely - using proper app framework
- ✅ Ready for shadcn/ui integration

**Technical Decisions**:
1. **React Router v7**: Serverless-first with Netlify Functions
2. **No Backend Needed**: Loaders/actions become API endpoints
3. **Tailwind v3.4**: Stable version, not alpha
4. **Phased Approach**: Foundation first, features second

**Next Steps**:
1. Install and configure shadcn/ui
2. Set up Tailwind CSS v3.4
3. Create basic route structure
4. Configure Netlify deployment

**Why It Matters**: Starting with the right foundation avoids the architectural conflicts that killed the Docusaurus attempt. This stack is proven to work together.
