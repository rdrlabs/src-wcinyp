# Recap Since Last Log

Summarize all work done since the last [log] entry without creating a new log.

## What [recap] Does
1. Finds the most recent log file
2. Summarizes everything done since then
3. Shows key decisions and changes
4. NO file creation - just displays summary

## Output Format
```
ðŸ“… Last log: 20250103_2157_minimal-ai-structure-decision.md

Since then:
âœ… Created AI prompt system
âœ… Renamed eval â†’ explore  
âœ… Added preview mode to [log]
âœ… Set up [audit] command
âœ… Implemented [utd] for doc sync

Key decisions:
- Chose flat log structure over year/month folders
- Renamed prompts for clarity
- Added bang (!) syntax for enhanced modes

Ready to [log] any of these items?
```

## Usage
- `[recap]` - Show work since last log
- Then use `[log]` to document specific items
- Or continue working without logging
