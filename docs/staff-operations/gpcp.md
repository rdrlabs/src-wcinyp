## Check-In Process

### System Access

- **Important**: We do not change patient status

### Using Appointment Desk
Check in from Appointment Desk to view all GPCP appointments for the day, including:
- Provider visits
- Lab appointments
- Multiple appointment coordination

### Authorization Status
1. Review patient authorization status for issues before the visit
2. Escalate any problems to the **GPCP Insurance Teams group chat**
3. Once cleared, inform providers in the **GPCP team's channel** with message: "patient x is on site"
4. Monitor chat for provider responses and potential delays

## Copayment Collection

As of **January 13, 2025**, GPCP copayments are collected at check-in.

### Guidelines
- Copayments that appear at check-in have been manually entered by leadership
- These amounts are accurate and should be collected
- For any collection issues, escalate to:
  - Management
  - WGC GPCP Insurance Chat

## Insurance Verification

### WGC GPCP Insurance Chat Purpose
This chat supports GPCP patients with insurance issues at check-in:

1. **SPC Actions**:
   - Upload patient insurance card to media tab
   - Message chat for Admin Specialist (AS) assistance
   
2. **Admin Specialist Response**:
   - Updates insurance information
   - Verifies insurance is active
   - Alerts SPC when complete

3. **Hard Stops**: Message GPCP insurance chat with issue/patient MRN for assistance

### Authorization Requirements

**As of February 11, 2025** (per Yesenia Echevarria):
- Office visits and lab visits **do not require** pre-authorization
- Only radiology appointments require pre-authorization

### What to Look For
Even with red authorization status, patients can proceed if:
- Insurance is verified for WCINYP service area
- Check-in list shows all green checks, or minimum:
  - Insurance verified
  - Hospital account current
  - Guarantor information updated (when possible)

**As of March 7, 2025**: Ensure patient checklist is fully green or has minimal required items verified.

## Scheduling Follow-ups

### Important Guidelines
- **Minimum scheduling**: Never less than 4 weeks out
  - Results take approximately 4 weeks to become available
- **Typical scheduling**: 4-6 weeks from current visit
- Providers will bring patients to checkout and specify timing

### Scheduling Process
1. **Use 'View Schedules'** - NOT Ancillary Order
2. Review appointment slot restrictions before selection
3. For follow-ups, use only:
   - "Follow Up" slots
   - "Follow Up Video Visit" slots
   - Unless otherwise specified by GPCP Admin/providers

### Video Visit Requirements
For video visits, verify:
- Patient will be physically located in the required state during appointment
