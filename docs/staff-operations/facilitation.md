# Facilitation Guidelines

Facilitators are crucial to maintaining a prompt schedule by consistently monitoring the DAR and Snapboard for patient status after check-in and acting as a liaison between clinical and administrative staff.

## Overview

### When Do We Facilitate?

Facilitation is not strictly assigned to an individual or shift. SPCs (Service Point Coordinators) will self-assign or are assigned the role as coverage is needed. 

**Ideal Coverage:**
- **Weekdays**: 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM
- **Requirements**: Sufficient staffing availability

Facilitators assist MRI and PET patients in preparing for their scans. The workflow changes based on modality.

## General Workflow

### Before Approaching a Patient

Facilitators must:
- Monitor the schedule and verify with techs when a patient can begin preps
- Review patients' packet for completion and note any safety concerns

### When Walking a Patient Back

Facilitators will:
- **Verify patient identity** using name and date of birth
- **Review screening form answers** to ensure safety
- **Guide patients to changing room** to secure possessions and change into metal-free attire
- **Deliver packet** to appropriate staff:
  - Give directly to tech for non-contrasted patients
  - Give to nurse for patients requiring IV placement

## Timing Guidelines

### Non-Contrasted Patients
- **Prep time**: 5-10 minutes before scan
- **Action**: Guide to sub-waiting area

### Contrasted Patients
- **Prep time**: 10-15 minutes before scan
- **Action**: Provide packet to nurse for IV placement and additional preparations

### Special Considerations
Facilitators evaluate if patients require additional time due to:
- Translation needs
- Mobility concerns
- Clinical questions
- General anxiety
- Other special circumstances

Adjust prep timing accordingly for these situations.

## PET-Specific Guidelines

### Coordination
- Confirm with PET techs when to bring patients back
- Verify specific PET prep room assignment

### PETMR Patients
- Change in standard changing room
- Receive dose in PETCT prep room (due to dose requirements)

## Pediatric Patients

### Child Life Specialist (CLS) Protocol
For pediatric patients requesting a CLS:
1. Inform the on-site specialist of patient arrival
2. CLS will complete all further preparations

### Feed & Swaddle Protocol
For all patients under 1 year old:
1. Set up private office **BEFORE** patient arrival
2. Notify CLS and nurses
3. Monitor preparations to ensure on-time scanning

## Additional Responsibilities

### Patient Communication
- Inform patients and guests of:
  - Wait times
  - Delays
  - Scan progress
- Offer amenities:
  - Water
  - Snacks
  - Warm blankets
  - Activity books
  - Connect help

### Schedule Management
- Suggest schedule adjustments to avoid delays based on live scanner status
- Ensure patients with multiple exams complete all studies before leaving

### Facility Maintenance
Sanitize as requested by techs:
- Patient lockers
- Sub-waiting areas
- PETCT prep rooms

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify patient identity** before any interaction
2. **Review safety screening thoroughly** - patient safety is paramount
3. **Communicate proactively** with clinical staff about patient status
4. **Be flexible** with timing based on patient needs
5. **Maintain cleanliness** of patient areas throughout the day
