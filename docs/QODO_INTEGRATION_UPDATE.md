# Qodo Merge Pro - Post-Installation Configuration Guide

## üéâ Installation Status: COMPLETE

**Congratulations!** Qodo Merge Pro was successfully installed on January 19, 2025.

### Current Setup
- **App**: Qodo Merge Pro
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active and ready to use
- **Repository Access**: All repositories
- **Permissions Granted**: 
  - ‚úÖ Read: actions, checks, metadata
  - ‚úÖ Read/Write: code, discussions, issues, pull requests

## What's Already Working

Since installation, Qodo Merge Pro is automatically:
- ü§ñ Monitoring all pull requests in your repositories
- üìù Ready to generate PR descriptions with `/describe`
- üîç Ready to perform code reviews with `/review`
- üí° Ready to suggest improvements with `/improve`

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test the Installation (5 minutes)

Create a test PR to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/qodo-integration

# Make a small change (e.g., update README)
echo "\n<!-- Testing Qodo Merge -->" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify Qodo Merge integration"
git push origin test/qodo-integration
```

Then open a PR and you should see Qodo automatically:
- Generate a PR description
- Perform an initial review

### 2. Install Chrome Extension (Optional but Recommended)

The Chrome extension enables AI chat directly in PRs:
1. Visit [Qodo Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qodo)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Sign in with your GitHub account
4. Now you can chat with Qodo directly in PR comments!

### 3. Create Configuration File (Recommended)

Create `.pr_agent.toml` in your repository root:

```toml
[pr_description]
# Automatic PR descriptions
publish_description_as_comment = false
add_original_user_description = true
generate_ai_title = true
ai_title_prefix = ""  # Or use "feat:", "fix:", etc.
include_generated_by_header = true

[pr_reviewer] 
# Code review settings
ask_and_reflect = true
remove_previous_review_comment = true
persistent_comment = true
inline_code_comments = true
require_tests_review = true
require_security_review = true

# Project-specific instructions
extra_instructions = """
Focus on:
- React 18 and Next.js 15 best practices
- TypeScript type safety
- Supabase security patterns
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
- Performance implications
- Healthcare data privacy considerations
"""

[pr_code_suggestions]
# Improvement suggestions
num_code_suggestions = 5
summarize_suggestions = true
focus_on_important_suggestions = true

[pr_custom_labels]
# Auto-labeling
enable_custom_labels = true
labels = ["bug", "feature", "docs", "test", "refactor", "security"]
```

### 4. Team Quick Reference Card

Share this with your team:

## Qodo Merge Commands

### Basic Commands
- `/describe` - Generate/update PR description
- `/review` - Perform code review
- `/improve` - Get code improvement suggestions
- `/ask [question]` - Ask specific questions

### Examples
- `/ask Is this accessible?`
- `/improve src/components/Button.tsx`
- `/review --focus security`

### Pro Tips
- Qodo learns from accepted suggestions
- It fetches context from linked issues
- 75 free PRs/month for our org
```

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Keep Both Tools (Recommended Initially)
- Run Qodo and CodeRabbit in parallel for 2 weeks
- Compare quality of reviews
- Gather team feedback
- Make informed decision

### Option 2: Qodo Only
- Disable CodeRabbit workflow
- Rely solely on Qodo Merge
- Save on CodeRabbit costs

### Option 3: Selective Usage
- Use Qodo for feature PRs
- Use CodeRabbit for dependency updates
- Optimize for 75 PR/month limit

## Usage Optimization (75 PRs/Month)

### Current Month Budget
- **Total**: 75 PRs
- **Used**: 0 (as of Jan 19)
- **Remaining**: 75

### Strategies
1. **Priority PRs** (use Qodo):
   - Feature branches
   - Bug fixes
   - Security updates
   - Complex refactors

2. **Skip Qodo** (save quota):
   - Documentation-only changes
   - Dependency bumps (unless security)
   - Style/formatting changes
   - Draft PRs

3. **Batch Changes**:
   - Group related fixes
   - Combine small improvements
   - Plan PR timing
