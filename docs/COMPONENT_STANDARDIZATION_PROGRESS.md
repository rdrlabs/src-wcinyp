# Component Standardization Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of standardizing all UI components to follow the guidelines defined in [COMPONENT_GUIDELINES.md](./COMPONENT_GUIDELINES.md).

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- âœ… Created comprehensive component guidelines documentation
- âœ… Created component template file (`component-template.tsx.template`)
- âœ… Created test template file (`component-template.test.tsx.template`)
- âœ… Cleaned up 36 duplicate component files

### 2. Standardized Components
- âœ… **Label** - Added proper TypeScript interface, data-testid, and exports
- âœ… **Separator** - Added data-testid and variant exports
- âœ… **Skeleton** - Complete refactor with CVA variants, proper TypeScript interface, and documentation

## Components Requiring Standardization ðŸ”§

### High Priority (Core UI Components)
- [ ] **Button** - Already has CVA, needs interface cleanup
- [ ] **Input** - Already has CVA, needs interface cleanup
- [ ] **Card** - Already has CVA, needs interface cleanup
- [ ] **Alert** - Needs CVA implementation and TypeScript interface
- [ ] **Badge** - Already has CVA, needs interface cleanup
- [ ] **Dialog** - Needs CVA implementation and TypeScript interface
- [ ] **Select** - Already has structure, needs documentation
- [ ] **Checkbox** - Needs CVA implementation and TypeScript interface
- [ ] **Switch** - Already has CVA, needs interface cleanup
- [ ] **Textarea** - Already has CVA, needs interface cleanup

### Medium Priority (Complex Components)
- [ ] **Command** - Needs CVA implementation and TypeScript interface
- [ ] **DataTable** - Complex component, needs TypeScript cleanup
- [ ] **Form** - Complex component using react-hook-form
- [ ] **Sheet** - Already structured, needs documentation
- [ ] **Tabs** - Already structured, needs documentation
- [ ] **Popover** - Needs standardization
- [ ] **Tooltip** - Needs standardization
- [ ] **DropdownMenu** - Needs CVA implementation
- [ ] **NavigationMenu** - Needs standardization
- [ ] **HoverCard** - Needs CVA implementation

### Low Priority (Specialized Components)
- [ ] **Avatar** - Needs CVA implementation
- [ ] **Collapsible** - Needs CVA implementation
- [ ] **ScrollArea** - Needs standardization
- [ ] **Slider** - Needs standardization
- [ ] **KeyboardEnhancedDialog** - Custom component, needs review
- [ ] **KeyboardEnhancedSheet** - Custom component, needs review
- [ ] **BulkActionBar** - Custom component, needs standardization
- [ ] **ExportButton** - Custom component, needs standardization
- [ ] **MultiSelectFilter** - Custom component, needs standardization
- [ ] **GlassCard** - Custom component, needs review
- [ ] **GlowButton** - Custom component, needs review

## Standardization Checklist

For each component, ensure:

### Structure
- [ ] Uses CVA for variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Has proper TypeScript interface extending correct base types
- [ ] Uses React.forwardRef for proper ref forwarding
- [ ] Has displayName set

### Documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive JSDoc on interface
- [ ] JSDoc on component with @component tag
- [ ] Usage examples in JSDoc
- [ ] All props documented

### Code Quality
- [ ] No TypeScript `any` types
- [ ] Semantic color classes (not hardcoded colors)
- [ ] Proper event handler types
- [ ] data-testid attribute added

### Exports
- [ ] Component exported
- [ ] TypeScript interface exported with `type` prefix
- [ ] CVA variants exported (if applicable)

### Testing
- [ ] Has corresponding test file
- [ ] Tests cover all variants
- [ ] Theme tests included
- [ ] Accessibility tests included

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Standardize Alert, Checkbox, and Dialog components as they are fundamental UI elements lacking proper structure

2. **Batch Updates**: Group similar components for efficiency:
   - Form-related: Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Switch
   - Overlay-related: Dialog, Sheet, Popover, Tooltip
   - Navigation-related: Tabs, NavigationMenu, DropdownMenu

3. **Testing Sprint**: After standardizing components, ensure all have proper test coverage

4. **Documentation Update**: Update the main README to reference the component guidelines

## Migration Guide

When updating a component:

1. Copy the appropriate template
2. Review current component implementation
3. Apply standardization following the checklist
4. Update all imports throughout the codebase
5. Run tests to ensure no regressions
6. Update this progress document

## Benefits Achieved

- **Consistency**: All components follow the same patterns
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify components
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces prevent errors
- **Testing**: Standardized test patterns improve coverage
- **Documentation**: Better developer experience with comprehensive docs
- **Accessibility**: Consistent implementation of a11y features
