# Future Ideas & Ambitious Features

This document contains features that were brainstormed but are not part of the immediate roadmap. These ideas are preserved for potential future consideration but should not distract from core functionality.

## Healthcare System Integration (Distant Future)

### Epic EMR Integration
- Patient data sync with PHI compliance
- Appointment scheduling API
- Provider schedule import
- Insurance verification
- **Note**: Requires Epic certification, significant resources, and may never be needed

### Workflow Automation
- Self-pay form auto-generation based on patient data
- Document routing based on type
- Automated reminders and follow-ups
- Batch printing with queue management

## Analytics & Machine Learning (Probably Overkill)

### Analytics Dashboard
- Usage metrics and trends
- Form completion rates
- Provider utilization reports
- Document access patterns

### Machine Learning Features
- Smart form field predictions
- Document classification
- Anomaly detection for security
- Predictive search suggestions
- **Reality Check**: These are complex and may not provide ROI

### Business Intelligence
- ROI measurement tools
- Cost savings calculator
- Efficiency metrics
- Custom report builder
- **Note**: Would require significant data infrastructure

## Advanced User Experience Features

### Real-time Collaboration
- Provider availability updates via WebSocket
- Live form collaboration for teams
- Activity feed for recent changes
- **Consider**: Is real-time necessary or would polling suffice?

### Knowledge Sharing System
Enable staff to contribute corrections and tips:
- "Suggest Edit" button on documentation pages
- Simple submission form for corrections
- File attachment support for screenshots
- Basic review workflow for submissions
- Email notifications for status updates
- Version control with attribution
- Authority levels for contributions
- **Question**: Could this be handled with existing tools?

## Mobile & Platform Extensions

### Native Mobile Apps
- iOS/Android companion applications
- Offline support with sync
- Push notifications
- Camera integration for document capture
- **Reality**: Mobile web might be sufficient

### Advanced Integrations
- Office 365 deep integration
- Teams embedded app
- Slack notifications
- Calendar sync
- **Note**: Each integration adds maintenance burden

## Performance & Technical Debt

### Advanced Architecture
- Migrate from client-only to hybrid rendering
- Implement proper state management (Redux/Zustand)
- Create Storybook for component documentation
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Service worker for offline support
- GraphQL API layer

### Enhanced Search
- Full-text search across all content with Elasticsearch
- Smart filters with saved presets
- Search history and AI suggestions
- Bulk operations support
- Natural language processing

## Nice-to-Have UI Features

### Navigation & Organization
- Breadcrumb navigation on all pages
- Recently viewed items tracking
- Favorites/bookmarks system
- Customizable dashboards
- Drag-and-drop file organization

### Data Management
- Version history for all changes
- Import/export templates
- Bulk data operations
- Advanced filtering with complex queries
- Data visualization tools

### User Experience Polish
- Onboarding tours
- Contextual help system
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Custom themes beyond dark/light
- Multi-language support

## Security & Compliance (Beyond MVP)

### Advanced Security
- Two-factor authentication with hardware keys
- Biometric authentication
- End-to-end encryption for all data
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Blockchain audit trails

### Compliance Features
- HIPAA compliance dashboard
- Automated compliance reports
- PHI detection and masking
- Access control matrices
- Forensic logging

## Questions to Consider Before Implementing Any of These

1. **Does this solve a real problem users are having?**
2. **Is there a simpler solution that would work?**
3. **What's the maintenance cost?**
4. **Will this complicate the user experience?**
5. **Is this a "nice to have" or a "need to have"?**

## Features That Might Need to Be Unwound

Based on current implementation, consider whether these add value:

1. **Wiki System** - With Fumadocs for docs, is a separate wiki needed?
2. **Command Palette (Cmd+K)** - Nice but adds complexity
3. **Star Ratings on Providers** - Where would ratings data come from?
4. **Multiple Affiliation Types** - Are all these distinctions necessary?

Remember: The best features are often the ones you don't build. Focus on core functionality that directly serves user needs.
