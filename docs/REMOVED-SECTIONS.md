- Tips for common problems
- Links to relevant Epic/NYP resources
- Department-specific workflow examples

#### 3. Architecture & Quality
- **Version Control**: Track all changes with attribution (who, what, when)
- **Authority Levels**: Clear distinction between Official docs and Community contributions
- **Quality Checks**: Automated duplicate detection and broken link scanning
- **Simple Review**: Submissions reviewed by appropriate department/IT staff

#### 4. Review Process
