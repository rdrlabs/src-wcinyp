# Qodo Free Tier Setup Guide

## üéØ Goal: Maximize 75 Free PRs/Month

This guide helps you extract maximum value from Qodo's free tier by optimizing configuration, workflows, and integrations.

## üìã Quick Setup Checklist

- [x] Qodo Merge Pro installed on GitHub
- [x] `.pr_agent.toml` configuration created
- [ ] Chrome extension installed
- [ ] MCP tools configured (optional)
- [ ] Test PR created
- [ ] Team commands documented

## 1. GitHub Integration (Already Complete ‚úÖ)

Your Qodo Merge Pro is already active. No additional setup needed!

## 2. Configuration File (Already Complete ‚úÖ)

The `.pr_agent.toml` file has been created with learning-optimized settings.

## 3. Chrome Extension Setup (Recommended)

The Chrome extension enables AI chat directly in PRs:

1. **Install Extension**
   - Visit: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-agent-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl
   - Click "Add to Chrome"
   - Sign in with GitHub when prompted

2. **Features Unlocked**
   - Chat with AI about specific code lines
   - Ask questions directly in PR comments
   - Get instant explanations
   - No PR quota usage for chat!

## 4. Essential PR Commands

### üéØ Core Commands (Use These Most)

```bash
/describe              # Auto-generate PR description
/review               # Full code review
/improve              # Get improvement suggestions
/ask [question]       # Ask specific questions
```

### üí° Smart Usage Examples

```bash
# Security-focused review
/ask Are there any security vulnerabilities in this code?

# Performance check
/ask What are the performance implications of this change?

# Learning opportunity
/ask Can you explain why this pattern is better than my approach?

# Accessibility audit
/review focus on accessibility concerns

# Test suggestions
/ask What tests should I add for this feature?
```

### üîß Utility Commands

```bash
/update_changelog     # Update CHANGELOG.md
/generate_labels      # Auto-label PR
/similar_issue        # Find related issues
/help                 # Show all commands
```

## 5. Free Tier Optimization Strategy

### üìä Monthly Budget: 75 PRs

**Recommended Distribution:**
- Week 1-2: 40 PRs (heavy development)
- Week 3: 20 PRs (refinements)
- Week 4: 15 PRs (buffer + fixes)

### üéØ Prioritization Rules

**Always Use Qodo For:**
- ‚úÖ Feature branches
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes
- ‚úÖ Security updates
- ‚úÖ Complex refactors
- ‚úÖ New components
- ‚úÖ API changes

**Skip Qodo For:**
- ‚ùå Draft PRs (auto-skipped)
- ‚ùå Pure documentation
- ‚ùå Dependency bumps (unless security)
- ‚ùå Style-only changes
- ‚ùå GitHub Actions tweaks
- ‚ùå Config file updates

### üí° Pro Tips

1. **Batch Small Changes**
   ```bash
   # Instead of 3 PRs:
   - Fix typo in Button
   - Fix typo in Card  
   - Fix typo in Modal
   
   # Create 1 PR:
   - Fix typos in UI components
   ```

2. **Use Interactive Mode**
   ```bash
   # Don't create multiple PRs to explore
   # Use /ask to iterate in one PR:
   /ask How can I improve this component's performance?
   /ask What about accessibility?
   /ask Show me a better pattern
   ```

3. **Learning-Focused Questions**
   ```bash
   /ask Why is this approach better than [alternative]?
   /ask What are the trade-offs of this pattern?
   /ask How would a senior dev refactor this?
   ```

## 6. MCP Integration (Optional Advanced)

Model Context Protocol tools extend Qodo's capabilities:

### GitHub MCP Setup

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   brew install node  # macOS
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub MCP**
   - Create GitHub Personal Access Token:
     - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
     - Generate new token with `repo` scope
   
3. **Add to Qodo Gen** (VS Code)
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "github": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
         "env": {
           "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
