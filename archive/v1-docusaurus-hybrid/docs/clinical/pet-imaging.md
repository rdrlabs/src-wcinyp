## Frequently Asked Questions

### Patient FAQs

**1. Can I have acupuncture before FDG PET/CT?**
- Not allowed due to muscle uptake per Nuclear Medicine radiologists

**2. What about continuous glucose monitors?**
- Set to nighttime/basal mode 4 hours before appointment
- No removal necessary
- Reschedule if bolus injection occurs during fast period

**3. Why are appointments time-sensitive?**
- Radioactive tracers have short half-lives
- Made off-site and transported
- Image quality depends on tracer activity

**4. Why must I fast?**
- Ensures adequate blood glucose levels
- FDG tracer mimics glucose
- Elevated glucose competes with tracer uptake

**5. How long is the scan?**
- SBTT exams: 20-25 minutes
- Whole body: 30-35 minutes
- Ga-68 PSMA: ~35 minutes
- PYL PSMA prostate: ~20 minutes
- Dotatate brain: 60 minutes on scanner

**6. Head positioning for claustrophobic patients?**
- SBTT: Head in scanner 6-8 minutes
- Whole body: Head in scanner 10-15 minutes

**7. When to take anti-anxiety medication?**
- Wait until on-site for technologist instructions

**8. Oral contrast requirements?**
- 1 liter flavored contrast (drink as tolerated)
- Not required for prostate or brain exams

**9. Radiation safety precautions?**
- Radioactive for ~12 hours post-injection
- Stay 3 feet from children/pregnant women
- Normal activities otherwise permitted

### SPC FAQs

**1. Next-day FDG scheduling after 3 PM?**
- Call techs to order additional dose
- Orders typically placed 4-5 PM

**2. Head and neck protocol timing?**
- No additional time needed

**3. Protocol date verification?**
- Update protocols over 1 month old

## Provider-Specific Information

| Provider | Special Requirements |
|----------|---------------------|
| **William I. Kuhel, MD** | Often requests PET/CT + CT neck soft tissue with contrast<br/>Can link if CT tech available<br/>Head & neck protocol needs no extra time |
| **Anna Nordvig, MD** | Frequently requests ASL with PET/MR<br/>Only available at DHK<br/>Check priors if unclear |
| **Sonja Blum, MD, PhD** | Also requests ASL frequently<br/>May be listed as "yes" to ASL in ordering comments |
| **Scott T. Tagawa, MD** | Almost always prefers Ga-68 PSMA over F-18 PSMA PYL<br/>Ensure protocol matches prescription |

## Critical Reminders

1. **All PET patients must remove all jewelry**
2. **Time sensitivity** - Emphasize arrival times
3. **Dose ordering** - After 3 PM for next day requires notification
4. **Protocol verification** - Update if >1 month old
5. **Provider preferences** - Check specific requirements
6. **FDOPA** - Never call patients; nurses handle all communication
7. **5th Saturdays** - No PSMA PYL service
