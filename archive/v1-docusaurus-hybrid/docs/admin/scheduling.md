# Scheduling Guidelines

This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of appointment scheduling for WCINYP imaging services, including standard procedures, special protocols, and system-specific instructions.

## General Scheduling Principles

### Essential Information Required

**For All Appointments**:
- Patient name and DOB
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Insurance information
- Ordering provider
- Valid prescription/order
- Diagnosis (ICD-10)
- Exam requested (CPT code)

### Scheduling Systems

**Primary System**: Epic

**Key Modules**:
- **Ancillary Orders**: For imaging appointments
- **View Schedules**: For follow-ups and office visits
- **Appointment Desk**: For check-in and multi-appointment view

## Modality-Specific Guidelines

### MRI Scheduling

**Standard Appointment Lengths**:
- Single region without contrast: 45 minutes
- Single region with contrast: 60 minutes
- Multiple regions: Add 30 minutes per region
- Special protocols: May require additional time

**Safety Screening Requirements**:
- Complete MRI safety questionnaire
- Verify implant compatibility
- Document any metal/devices
- Note claustrophobia concerns

**Contrast Considerations**:
- Verify kidney function if needed
- Note contrast allergies
- Schedule pre-medication if required
- Allow extra time for IV placement

### PET Scheduling

:::warning Critical
PET appointments are extremely time-sensitive due to radiotracer half-life. Emphasize punctuality to patients.
:::

**Scheduling Windows by Tracer**:

See [PET Imaging Protocols](/docs/clinical/pet-imaging) for detailed schedules.

**Key Considerations**:
- Verify preparation compliance ability
- Check for scheduling conflicts
- Note arrival time vs scan time
- Confirm phone number for delays

**Next-Day Scheduling**:
- After 3 PM: Call techs to order dose
- Orders typically placed 4-5 PM
- Document notification in Epic

### CT Scheduling

**Standard Times**:
- Non-contrast CT: 15-30 minutes
- With contrast: 30-45 minutes
- CT angiography: 45-60 minutes
- Multi-phase: 60+ minutes

**Preparation Requirements**:
- NPO status for abdomen/pelvis
- Kidney function for contrast
- Allergy pre-medication timing
- Oral contrast timing

### X-Ray and DEXA

**Walk-in vs Scheduled**:
- Most X-rays: Walk-in acceptable
- DEXA: Appointment required
- Special views: May need scheduling
- Pediatric: Prefer scheduled times

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Scheduling

**Additional Requirements**:
- Parent/guardian information
- Sedation needs assessment
- Child Life Specialist availability
- Feed & swaddle scheduling (under 1 year)

**Best Practices**:
- Schedule early in day when possible
- Allow extra time for cooperation
- Coordinate with CLS team
- Book private room if needed

### Pacemaker/ICD Patients

**Scheduling Process**:
1. Email NYP_MRIDepartment@nyp.org with:
   - Patient information
   - Order details
   - Pacemaker card (both sides)
2. Wait for approval from cardiology
3. Schedule only approved slots (usually Tuesday 1.5T)
4. Confirm reprogramming arrangements

### Sedation Cases

**Requirements**:
- Anesthesia clearance
- NPO instructions
- Recovery time allocation
- Transportation arrangements

**Contact**: NYP_MRIDepartment@nyp.org

## GPCP Follow-Up Scheduling

:::caution Important
GPCP follow-ups must use "View Schedules" NOT Ancillary Orders
:::

**Timing Rules**:
- NEVER less than 4 weeks from visit
- Typically 4-6 weeks out
- Provider will specify timing

**Slot Restrictions**:
- Use only "Follow Up" slots
- Video visits require state verification
- Check provider-specific limitations

See [GPCP Program Guide](/docs/staff-operations/gpcp) for details.

## Combination Studies

### Same-Day Multiple Exams

**Coordination Required**:
- Verify exam compatibility
- Sequence appropriately
- Allow adequate time between
- Single copayment (highest)

**Optimal Sequencing**:
1. Non-contrast exams first
2. Oral contrast exams
3. IV contrast exams
4. Nuclear medicine last

### Linked Studies

**Common Combinations**:
- PET/CT + diagnostic CT
- MRI brain + MRA
- CT chest + CT abdomen/pelvis

**Requirements**:
- Verify tech availability
- Confirm protocol compatibility
- Document linking in Epic
- Inform patient of extended time

## Urgent/STAT Scheduling

### Priority Levels

**STAT** (Same day):
- Life-threatening conditions
- Pre-surgical urgent
- Acute stroke protocol

**Urgent** (24-48 hours):
- Suspected malignancy
- Acute pain evaluation
- Post-procedure complications

**Routine** (Standard scheduling):
- Follow-up studies
- Chronic conditions
- Screening exams

### STAT Approval Process

1. Verify medical necessity
2. Contact lead tech for availability
3. Obtain authorization if possible
4. Document approval source
5. Notify relevant staff

## Rescheduling Protocols

### Patient-Initiated Rescheduling

**Process**:
1. Verify patient identity
2. Document reason for change
3. Check preparation requirements
4. Offer next available appropriate slot
5. Update confirmation status

### Facility-Initiated Rescheduling

**Required Actions**:
- Call patient immediately
- Explain reason clearly
- Offer multiple alternatives
- Document all attempts
- Escalate if needed

## Schedule Optimization

### Preventing Gaps

**Strategies**:
- Maintain waitlist
- Offer same-day openings
- Coordinate lunch coverage
- Monitor no-show patterns

### Overbooking Guidelines

**When Permitted**:
- STAT cases only
- Lead tech approval
- Documented plan
- Staff availability confirmed

## System Documentation

### Required Epic Documentation

**Every Appointment Must Include**:
- Accurate exam ordered
- Correct protocol
- Preparation given
- Special needs noted
- Authorization number

### Appointment Comments

**Include**:
- Implant information
- Arrival time if different
- Interpreter needs
- Mobility limitations
- Previous issues

## Quality Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

**Monitor**:
- Schedule utilization rate
- No-show percentage
- Same-day cancellations
- Patient wait times
- Prep non-compliance

### Daily Reviews

**Check for**:
- Missing orders
- Authorization status
- Prep requirements
- Staffing coverage
- Equipment availability

## Best Practices

1. **Verify before booking**: Insurance, authorization, and order
2. **Communicate clearly**: Prep instructions and arrival times
3. **Document thoroughly**: All patient interactions
4. **Think ahead**: Anticipate potential issues
5. **Collaborate**: With clinical staff for complex cases

## Common Scheduling Errors to Avoid

- Booking without valid order
- Ignoring prep requirements
- Mismatched protocol to indication
- Inadequate time allocation
- Missing authorization verification
- Forgetting interpreter needs
- Not checking implant safety
- Overlooking contrast allergies

## Escalation Guidelines

**When to Escalate**:
- Authorization denials
- Physician disagreements
- System errors
- Angry patients
- Safety concerns

**Escalation Path**:
1. Lead technologist
2. Practice specialist
3. Practice manager
4. Department administrator

Remember: Accurate scheduling is crucial for patient satisfaction, department efficiency, and quality care delivery. When in doubt, ask for guidance.
