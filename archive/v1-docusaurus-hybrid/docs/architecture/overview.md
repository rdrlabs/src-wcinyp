# Architecture Overview

This medical imaging knowledge base system is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed for internal administrative use at medical facilities.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend Stack
- **Docusaurus v3.8** - Documentation platform and static site generator
- **React 19** - UI framework with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript (strict mode enabled)
- **Tailwind CSS v4.1** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern component library

### Key Features
- **Provider Directory Management** - Searchable database of medical providers
- **Document Management** - Medical imaging protocols and procedures
- **Form Generation** - Dynamic form creation for administrative workflows
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach for multi-device access

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Start with solid foundations and build sophisticated features incrementally while maintaining zero-downtime availability.

### 2. Type Safety First
TypeScript strict mode enforces compile-time error prevention, critical for medical data accuracy.

### 3. Component Composition
Reusable, testable, and accessible components following modern React patterns.

### 4. Documentation-Driven Development
Code and documentation evolve together, ensuring knowledge preservation.

## Data Architecture

### No Patient PHI
**IMPORTANT**: This system contains **NO patient PHI (Protected Health Information)**. It is strictly an internal administrative tool handling:
- Provider contact information
- Imaging protocols and procedures
- Administrative forms and workflows
- Medical staff directory management

### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data management
- **Client State**: Local component state with useState/useReducer
- **Global UI State**: Context API for theme, modals, etc.

## Security Considerations

For production deployment in medical environments, additional security measures should be implemented:
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for administrative actions
- HTTPS enforcement

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting** - Lazy loading of route components
- **Virtual Scrolling** - Efficient rendering of large provider lists
- **Search Optimization** - Client-side search with FlexSearch.js
- **Image Optimization** - Automated image compression and WebP conversion

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user workflow validation
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

## Deployment

- **Platform**: Netlify with atomic deployments
- **Build Process**: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **Environment**: Static site with API integration capabilities
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for fast access
