# Convert to MD Directory - PDF Inventory

This directory previously contained 6 PDF files that appear to be documentation or guides that were meant to be converted to Markdown format.

## Files that were here:

1. **Facilitation.pdf** - Likely a guide for facilitating meetings or processes
2. **GPCP.pdf** - Possibly "General Practice Clinical Protocols" or similar
3. **PET INFO.pdf** - Information about PET scan procedures
4. **WCINYP Directory.pdf** - Directory of WCINYP locations or contacts
5. **confirmation calls.pdf** - Guide for making confirmation calls
6. **misc reports.pdf** - Miscellaneous report templates or guidelines

## Note
These files were not moved to the public documents directory as they appear to be internal documentation rather than patient-facing forms. They have been removed to save repository space. If needed, they should be recreated as proper markdown documentation files.
