# Minimal AI Structure Decision

**Summary**: Chose flat log structure over complex year/month folders. Keeping it simple for 2-6 month project lifespan.

**Key Points**:
- Flat `/logs/` directory with date-prefixed files
- `.ai/INDEX.md` for prompt discovery
- ~50 files manageable without subdirectories
- Can add `archive/` later if needed

**Why it matters**: Avoids premature optimization. Easy to upgrade later if project grows beyond expected timeline.

**Structure**:
```
├── CLAUDE.md (minimal entry)
├── .ai/
│   ├── prompts/ (sync, test, commit, log)
│   └── INDEX.md (prompt catalog)
└── logs/ (flat chronological)
```
