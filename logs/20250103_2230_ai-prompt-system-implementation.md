# AI Prompt System Implementation

**Summary**: Created comprehensive AI development foundation with 8 prompt commands. Focused on simplicity, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Established prompt template system with [command] syntax
- ✅ Renamed prompts for clarity: eval→explore, review→audit
- ✅ Added bang syntax (!) for enhanced modes (explore!, formerly log!)
- ✅ Created [recap] to see work without creating logs
- ✅ Built [utd] for doc synchronization

**Design Decisions**:
- Chose flat `/logs/` structure over year/month folders (avoid premature optimization)
- [log] always previews (removed confusing immediate mode)
- [explore!] for deep analysis vs standard [explore]
- Removed [tier] prompt (overcomplicated, not needed)

**Why It Matters**: Clean prompt system enables consistent workflows, reduces cognitive load, and scales naturally as project grows.

**Not Logged But Relevant**:
- Considered [review] vs [audit] naming (audit won for clarity)
- Discussed prompt versioning gap (decided to skip for now)
- You emphasized simplicity over feature creep
