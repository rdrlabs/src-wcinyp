## Testing

### Known Issues with Claude Code

**Test Timeout Issues**: When running tests through Claude Code, you may encounter timeout errors that don't occur when running tests directly in your terminal. This is a limitation of Claude Code's bash tool which has a default timeout of 2 minutes (120 seconds), but tests in watch mode need to run indefinitely.

**Current Limitation**: 
- Claude Code's bash tool times out after 120 seconds by default
- Maximum configurable timeout is 600000ms (10 minutes)
- Watch mode tests (`npm test`) run indefinitely, so they will ALWAYS timeout
- This is a fundamental limitation - Claude Code cannot run persistent processes

**Workarounds**:
1. Run tests without watch mode: `npm test -- --run` or `npm run test:ci`
2. Run specific test files: `npm test -- src/app/page.test.tsx`
3. Use the test:ci script which runs tests once and exits

**Claude Code Team**: This is a significant limitation for development workflows. Consider:
- Allowing infinite timeout for watch processes
- Detecting watch mode and handling differently
- Providing a way to interrupt/stop long-running processes without timeout

**Note**: All tests pass successfully when run with `--run` flag. The timeout only affects watch mode which keeps the process running indefinitely.

### Testing Philosophy

Following [Testing Library principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles):
- Test the application like a user would use it
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Query elements by accessibility roles when possible
- Write tests that give confidence the application works

## Claude Task Master Integration

### Overview
Claude Task Master is an AI-powered task management system designed to work seamlessly with Claude in development environments like Cursor, providing persistent task tracking and intelligent task breakdown capabilities.

### Installation & Configuration

#### 1. Local Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install --save-dev task-master-ai
```

#### 2. Initialize Project
```bash
npx task-master init
# Answer prompts:
# - Shell aliases: Y (allows using 'tm' instead of 'task-master')
# - Git repository: N (already exists)
```

#### 3. Configure Models for Claude Code (No API Key Required)
```bash
npx task-master models --set-main opus --claude-code
npx task-master models --set-research sonnet --claude-code
npx task-master models --set-fallback sonnet --claude-code
```

#### 4. Project Structure Created
```

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.mermaid
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technical.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. **Persistent Task Management**
- Tasks stored in `tasks/tasks.md` survive between Claude sessions
- Completed tasks archived in `tasks/completed/`
- Clear task states: pending, in-progress, completed, blocked

#### 2. **AI-Enhanced Development**
- `.cursorrules` file guides AI behavior with project-specific rules
- Required file reads on startup for context
- Automated validation requirements before task completion

#### 3. **Task Templates**
- `feature.md` - Comprehensive feature development checklist
- `bug-fix.md` - Structured bug fix workflow
- Templates ensure consistent development practices

#### 4. **Project Documentation**
- `architecture.mermaid` - Visual system architecture
- `technical.md` - Technical specifications and patterns
- `progress.md` - Development progress tracking

### Usage Examples

#### Task Management Commands
```bash
# List all tasks
npx task-master list

# Show next task to work on
npx task-master next

# Show specific task details
npx task-master show 1

# Update task status
npx task-master set-status --id=1 --status=in-progress

# Add a new task with AI
npx task-master add-task --prompt="Create API endpoint for user registration"
```

#### Task Organization
```bash
# Create a new tag for feature branch
npx task-master add-tag feat/backend-auth "Backend authentication feature"

# Switch to different tag context
npx task-master use-tag feat/backend-auth

# List all tags
npx task-master tags
```

#### Advanced Features
```bash
# Parse PRD to generate tasks
npx task-master parse-prd --input=.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt

# Expand task into subtasks
npx task-master expand --id=1 --num=5

# Research with project context
npx task-master research "Best practices for Netlify Functions with TypeScript"

# Sync tasks to README
npx task-master sync-readme
```

### Benefits

1. **Continuity**: Tasks persist across Claude sessions
2. **Context Awareness**: AI understands project structure and conventions
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation requirements
4. **Organized Workflow**: Templates and consistent practices
5. **Progress Visibility**: Clear tracking of development status

### Notes

- Task Master stores all data locally in your project
- No cross-project contamination
- Works with git branches via tagged contexts
- Integrates with MCP for editor support

### ‚úÖ Current Status

Task Master v0.19.0 is successfully installed and configured:
- **Local installation** in project (not global)
- **Claude Code mode** configured (no API key required)
- **Models configured**: Opus for main, Sonnet for research/fallback
- **Project initialized** with `.taskmaster/` directory structure

### Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Claude Code Integration**: The `parse-prd` command fails with Claude Code API errors. This appears to be a limitation of the Claude Code CLI integration.

2. **Task Display**: The `list` command shows empty results even with tasks in the file. This is due to the tag-based structure expecting tasks under the current tag.

3. **Manual Task Creation**: Since AI task generation has issues with Claude Code, manually create tasks in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` following the structure shown in examples.

### MCP Server Integration (Alternative Approach)

Instead of using the CLI directly, you can configure Task Master as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for better integration with Claude Desktop and IDE environments.

#### Claude Desktop Configuration
Create or update `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {},
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code Configuration
Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "taskmaster-ai": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
    "type": "stdio"
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE Configuration
Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {},
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: After creating these configurations, restart your IDE or Claude Desktop to activate the MCP server connection.

### Hybrid Approach

Use Task Master for structure and persistence, with manual task management:
1. **Task Storage**: Use `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` for machine-readable tasks
2. **Human Reference**: Maintain `tasks/tasks.md` for quick viewing
3. **Templates**: Use `tasks/templates/` for consistent task creation
4. **Documentation**: Keep PRD in `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` for context

## Repository Management & Gitignore Configuration

### Archive Management Strategy (Jan 2025)

We experienced a major PR issue with +30,895 ‚àí4,812,622 changes due to improper gitignore configuration. This has been resolved with a "skeleton archive" approach:

#### 1. **Archive Skeleton Philosophy**
Archives preserve the historical record of failed attempts while removing dangerous artifacts:
- ‚úÖ **Preserved**: All source code (.tsx, .ts, .js), documentation (.md), configurations
- ‚ùå **Removed**: node_modules, package-lock.json, coverage reports, build outputs
- **Result**: Archives serve as educational skeletons showing what was attempted

#### 2. **Enhanced .gitignore**
Added specific patterns to prevent only dangerous artifacts:
```
# Archive dangerous artifacts only
/archive/**/node_modules/
/archive/**/package-lock.json
/archive/**/coverage/
/archive/**/lcov-report/
/archive/**/.next/
/archive/**/build/
/archive/**/dist/
/archive/**/.cache/
/archive/**/.docusaurus/

# Duplicate files (common pattern from macOS/file conflicts)
**/* 2.*
**/* 3.*
**/* 4.*
**/* 2/
**/* 3/
**/* 4/
```

#### 3. **What Archives Contain**
Example: `archive/v1-docusaurus-hybrid/` contains:
- 38 documentation files (.md) including handoff reports
- 48 source code files showing the implementation attempt
- Configuration files (docusaurus.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Static assets and original PDFs
- Test suites showing the TDD approach

#### 4. **Security & Conflict Prevention**
- No dependencies that could conflict with main app
- No build artifacts that could interfere
- Clear separation between active code and historical record
- Archives are read-only references for learning

This approach maintains the educational value of failed attempts while ensuring repository safety and preventing massive PR diffs.

## Migration Notes

This application was migrated from React Router v7 to Next.js 14 to enable:
- Better documentation support with Fumadocs
- Improved performance with static generation
- Native MDX support
- Enhanced SEO capabilities

The React Router version is archived in `/archive/react-router-version/` for reference.

### Fumadocs Implementation

The knowledge base (`/knowledge`) uses Fumadocs for technical documentation:

- **Isolated Styling** - RootProvider only in knowledge layout
- **Default Theme** - Uses Fumadocs' built-in styling system
- **No Style Conflicts** - Completely separated from main app styles
- **Full Features** - Sidebar navigation, search, and table of contents
- **MDX Support** - Rich documentation with components

### Wiki Implementation

The wiki system (`/wiki`) provides a simpler MDX-based documentation approach for internal work documentation:

- **Client-side rendering** - Compatible with Netlify static export
- **MDX content** - Stored in `/content/wiki/` directory
- **Categories** - Policies, Procedures, Locations, Departments, Emergency, Workflows
- **Search functionality** - Built-in search across wiki sections
- **Navigation sidebar** - Easy access to all wiki sections

The wiki complements the Fumadocs-powered knowledge base by focusing on internal operational documentation rather than technical documentation.
