## Testing

### Known Issues with Claude Code

**Test Timeout Issues**: When running tests through Claude Code, you may encounter timeout errors that don't occur when running tests directly in your terminal. This is a limitation of Claude Code's bash tool which has a default timeout of 2 minutes (120 seconds), but tests in watch mode need to run indefinitely.

**Current Limitation**: 
- Claude Code's bash tool times out after 120 seconds by default
- Maximum configurable timeout is 600000ms (10 minutes)
- Watch mode tests (`npm test`) run indefinitely, so they will ALWAYS timeout
- This is a fundamental limitation - Claude Code cannot run persistent processes

**Workarounds**:
1. Run tests without watch mode: `npm test -- --run` or `npm run test:ci`
2. Run specific test files: `npm test -- src/app/page.test.tsx`
3. Use the test:ci script which runs tests once and exits

**Claude Code Team**: This is a significant limitation for development workflows. Consider:
- Allowing infinite timeout for watch processes
- Detecting watch mode and handling differently
- Providing a way to interrupt/stop long-running processes without timeout

**Note**: All tests pass successfully when run with `--run` flag. The timeout only affects watch mode which keeps the process running indefinitely.

### Testing Philosophy

Following [Testing Library principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles):
- Test the application like a user would use it
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Query elements by accessibility roles when possible
- Write tests that give confidence the application works

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on Netlify with automatic builds from the main branch.

### Pre-Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

- [x] All tests passing (274/274)
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] ESLint with no errors
- [x] Production build successful
- [x] Fumadocs fully integrated at /knowledge
- [x] All console.logs removed
- [x] No TypeScript 'any' types
- [x] README documentation updated

### Deployment Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
- Next.js plugin configuration
- Node.js v20 requirement
- Security headers
- Static export configuration

### Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Complete Fumadocs integration and code quality improvements"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Netlify will automatically**:
   - Detect the push
   - Run the build process
   - Deploy to production

### Post-Deployment Validation

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Knowledge base (/knowledge) shows Fumadocs interface
- [ ] All navigation works
- [ ] Forms can be filled and submitted
- [ ] Documents can be downloaded
- [ ] No console errors in production

## Migration Notes

This application was migrated from React Router v7 to Next.js 14 to enable:
- Better documentation support with Fumadocs
- Improved performance with static generation
- Native MDX support
- Enhanced SEO capabilities

The React Router version is archived in `/archive/react-router-version/` for reference.

### Wiki Implementation

The wiki system (`/wiki`) provides a simpler MDX-based documentation approach for internal work documentation:

- **Client-side rendering** - Compatible with Netlify static export
- **MDX content** - Stored in `/content/wiki/` directory
- **Categories** - Policies, Procedures, Locations, Departments, Emergency, Workflows
- **Search functionality** - Built-in search across wiki sections
- **Navigation sidebar** - Easy access to all wiki sections

The wiki complements the Fumadocs-powered knowledge base by focusing on internal operational documentation rather than technical documentation.
