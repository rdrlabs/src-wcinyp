### Testing Philosophy

Following [Testing Library principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles):
- Test the application like a user would use it
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Query elements by accessibility roles when possible
- Write tests that give confidence the application works

## üìö Documentation Structure

All project documentation is organized in the `.project-docs/` directory:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
System architecture, migration notes, and implementation details

- [**Netlify Architecture Considerations**](.project-docs/architecture/NETLIFY_ARCHITECTURE.md) üìä
  Netlify serves Next.js as a **static site** unless you use Netlify Functions. This means:
- [**WCINYP Next.js Migration**](.project-docs/architecture/MIGRATION.md) üìä
  This directory contains the migrated Next.js 14 version of WCINYP with:
- [**Fumadocs Implementation Plan**](.project-docs/architecture/FUMADOCS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
  This document outlines the complete implementation plan for integrating Fumadocs into the WCINYP application. Currently, the Knowledge Base page (`/knowledge`) is a static page with hardcoded links, but it should be a full Fumadocs-powered documentation system.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development
Development guides, testing strategies, and contribution guidelines

- [**Testing Strategy for AI-Assisted Development**](.project-docs/development/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
  As an AI assistant, I need tests because:
- [**Testing Guide for Rapid UI Evolution**](.project-docs/development/TESTING_GUIDE.md) üìä
  This guide documents our testing strategy designed to support rapid UI/UX changes while maintaining test confidence.
- [**Technical Debt & Improvement Plan**](.project-docs/development/TECH_DEBT.md) üìä
  **Status**: RESOLVED
- [**Contributing to WCINYP**](.project-docs/development/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  1. Ensure you have Node.js 20+ installed
- [**WCINYP Next.js Application**](.project-docs/development/CLAUDE.md)
  This is a medical imaging center application built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides document management, provider directory, form generation, and contact management features.

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on Netlify with automatic builds from the main branch.

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
- Next.js plugin configuration
- Node.js v20 requirement
- Security headers

## Migration Notes

This application was migrated from React Router v7 to Next.js 14 to enable:
- Better documentation support with Fumadocs
- Improved performance with static generation
- Native MDX support
- Enhanced SEO capabilities

The React Router version is archived in `/archive/react-router-version/` for reference.

### Wiki Implementation

The wiki system (`/wiki`) provides a simpler MDX-based documentation approach for internal work documentation:

- **Client-side rendering** - Compatible with Netlify static export
- **MDX content** - Stored in `/content/wiki/` directory
- **Categories** - Policies, Procedures, Locations, Departments, Emergency, Workflows
- **Search functionality** - Built-in search across wiki sections
- **Navigation sidebar** - Easy access to all wiki sections

The wiki complements the Fumadocs-powered knowledge base by focusing on internal operational documentation rather than technical documentation.
