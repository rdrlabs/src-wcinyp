# Self-Pay Form Automation

The self-pay form automation feature in WCINYP helps streamline the patient billing process by automatically generating personalized forms based on patient data, insurance status, and procedure type.

## Overview

Self-pay form automation reduces manual entry errors and improves collection rates by:

- Pre-filling patient information from existing records
- Automatically calculating costs based on procedure codes
- Generating location-specific forms (55th Street, Broadway, etc.)
- Supporting multiple languages (English and Spanish)

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Patient Data Population

When a patient is identified as self-pay, the system automatically:

- Retrieves patient demographic information
- Checks insurance eligibility status
- Identifies the service location
- Determines the appropriate form template

### 2. Dynamic Form Selection

The system intelligently selects the correct form based on:

- **Location**: Each facility has its own ABN forms
- **Procedure Type**: Special forms for Calcium Score, MRI, CT, etc.
- **Language Preference**: English or Spanish versions
- **Insurance Status**: Self-pay vs. off-hours insurance

### 3. Cost Calculation

Automated cost calculation includes:

- Base procedure costs
- Facility fees
- Technical fees
- Professional fees
- Applicable discounts

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Patient Registration

```
1. Verify patient is self-pay or insurance is inactive
2. Confirm procedure type and location
3. Check for existing financial agreements
```

### Step 2: Form Generation

The system generates the appropriate form with:

- Patient demographics pre-filled
- Procedure details and costs
- Payment terms and conditions
- Digital signature fields

### Step 3: Review and Approval

Staff can:

- Review generated forms for accuracy
- Make manual adjustments if needed
- Send forms for patient signature
- Track form completion status

## Best Practices

### Data Accuracy

- Verify patient information before generation
- Confirm procedure codes are correct
- Double-check cost calculations
- Ensure location-specific requirements are met

### Compliance

- Maintain HIPAA compliance
- Follow Medicare ABN requirements
- Document all financial discussions
- Store signed forms securely

### Patient Communication

- Explain costs clearly
- Provide payment options
- Offer financial assistance information
- Follow up on unsigned forms

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Walk-in Self-Pay Patient

When a patient arrives without insurance:

1. Register patient in system
2. Select "Self-Pay" as payment method
3. System auto-generates appropriate waiver
4. Review costs with patient
5. Obtain signature before service

### Scenario 2: Insurance After-Hours

For patients with insurance seen outside normal hours:

1. Verify insurance cannot be confirmed
2. Generate "Off-Hours Insurance Waiver"
3. Explain potential patient responsibility
4. Process insurance when available

### Scenario 3: Medicare ABN Required

When Medicare may not cover a service:

1. System identifies Medicare patient
2. Checks procedure coverage rules
3. Generates location-specific ABN
4. Documents reason for ABN

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Generating

If forms fail to generate:

- Check patient registration is complete
- Verify procedure codes are valid
- Ensure location is selected
- Confirm form templates are configured

### Incorrect Costs

If costs appear incorrect:

- Review fee schedule settings
- Check for special pricing rules
- Verify discount applications
- Confirm location-specific rates
