# Self-Pay Workflow Guide

This guide walks you through the complete self-pay workflow process at WCINYP.

## Overview

The self-pay workflow is designed to streamline the process for patients who are paying out-of-pocket for imaging services.

## Step 1: Patient Identification

When a patient indicates they will be self-pay:

1. Verify patient information
2. Check for any existing insurance on file
3. Confirm self-pay status with patient

## Step 2: Price Transparency

Provide clear pricing information:

- Show estimated costs for requested services
- Explain any available discounts
- Discuss payment options

## Step 3: Form Completion

Guide the patient through required forms:

1. Navigate to **Form Generator**
2. Select "Self Pay Waiver Form"
3. Enter patient information:
   - Name and contact details
   - Service requested
   - Estimated cost

## Step 4: Payment Processing

### Payment Options
- Cash or check at time of service
- Credit/debit card payment
- Payment plan arrangements (if eligible)

### Required Documentation
- Signed self-pay agreement
- Payment receipt
- Service authorization

## Step 5: Service Delivery

Once payment is processed:
