### Creating a New Form

#### 1. Choose a Starting Point

Select how you want to create your form:

- **Start from Template**: Use pre-built templates for common forms
- **Blank Form**: Build from scratch with full customization
- **Duplicate Existing**: Copy and modify an existing form

#### 2. Add Form Fields

Select from a variety of field types:

| Field Type | Description | Best For |
|:-----------|:------------|:---------|
| **Text** | Single line | Names, IDs |
| **Textarea** | Multi-line | Comments |
| **Select** | Dropdown | Fixed choices |
| **Checkbox** | Multi-select | Options |
| **Radio** | Single choice | Either/or |
| **Date** | Date picker | DOB, appointments |
| **File** | Upload files | Documents |
| **Number** | Numeric only | Quantities |
| **Email** | Validated email | Contact info |
| **Phone** | Formatted phone | Contact numbers |

#### 3. Configure Field Properties

For each field, customize these settings:

- **Label**: Clear, descriptive display name
- **Name**: Internal identifier (no spaces)
- **Required**: Mark if field is mandatory
- **Validation**: Add rules (min/max length, patterns)
- **Default Value**: Pre-fill with data
- **Help Text**: Provide guidance to users

> **Tip**: Use descriptive labels and helpful text to guide users through your form

## Form Logic

### Conditional Fields

Show/hide fields based on user responses:

> **Info**: Conditional logic allows you to create dynamic forms that adapt based on user input.

```javascript
// Example: Show additional field when "Other" is selected
{
  condition: {
    field: 'insuranceType',
    operator: 'equals',
    value: 'Other'
  },
  action: {
    show: ['specifyInsurance']
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

Build robust forms with comprehensive validation:

{/* <Cards>
  All Card components removed
</Cards> */}
- **✓ Required Fields** - Ensure critical information is collected
- **📧 Email Validation** - Verify proper email format automatically
- **📱 Phone Formatting** - Format phone numbers consistently
- **🔍 Pattern Matching** - Use regex for custom validation rules
- **📅 Date Restrictions** - Set valid date ranges for appointments
