## Pending Merge (Status Check Issues) ⚠️
These PRs have been updated and are ready to merge but are blocked by branch protection requiring "test (20.x)" status check:

- **PR #15**: UI Components & Theming System
  - All conflicts resolved
  - Simplified footer kept as requested

## Status Check Issue
The branch protection rules require a "test (20.x)" status check from the old CI workflow. The new CI workflow (from PR #13) uses different job names, causing a mismatch. 

### Resolution Options:
1. Update branch protection rules to use new status check names
2. Temporarily disable branch protection to merge remaining PRs
3. Wait for new CI to run and establish new status checks

## Completed Tasks ✅
- Removed all duplicate files from merge conflicts
- Fixed all merge conflicts across PRs
- Added Qodo Merge task to taskmaster as requested
- Successfully merged 3 out of 6 split PRs

## Next Steps
1. Resolve branch protection status check issue
2. Merge remaining PRs (#15, #16, #17)
3. Close dependabot PRs or merge compatible ones
4. Cancel CodeRabbit subscription
5. Implement Qodo Merge for future code reviews
